# PhysicalMultiTimeSeries

## problem setup
As part of my thesis work, we aim to learn a generalized mapping from the lift force $F_{lift}(t)$ generated by a flapping wing to its 3 degrees of angle motion pitch yaw and roll $\left(\phi(t), \psi(t), \theta(t)\right):=K(t)$.

Generalizing the above, given a time window of features with size $H$

$$[F_1(t),F_2(t),...,F_M(t)]_{t=t_0}^{t_0+H}$$

we provide a prediction up to time $t_0+H+T$
$$[T_1(t),T_2(t),...,T_N(t)]_{t=t_0+H+1}^{t_0+H+T}$$


## Framework
PMTS is a generalized library for multi target, multivariate time series prediction for physical experiments, mapping kinematics to forces or vice-versa.

We have developed a framework that offers a `Trainer` class, which can be used to train a customized nn.Module model from PyTorch. The Trainer class is designed to work with features tensor shaped as `(N,H,F)` and target tensor shaped as `(N,H,T)`, where `N` represents the number of datasets, `H` represents the provided history, `F` represents the number of features, and `T` represents the number of targets.

Our Trainer class comes with commonly used parameters such as batch size, train size, feature window size, and more. With an intuitive API similar to other popular frameworks, you can use the `.fit()` function to train your model and the `.predict()` function to generate predictions.
